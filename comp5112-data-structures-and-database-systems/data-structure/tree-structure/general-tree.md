# General Tree

The tree is a hierarchical data structure.&#x20;

A tree is a set of connected nodes such that

* There is one root (the node without parent)
* Each node (except the root) has one parent node
* Each node can have any number of child nodes
  * Internal node: a node with at least one child
  * Leaf node (a.k.a. external node): a node without any child

Height of a tree: the maximum path length（树高层数-1）

* e.g., the height of tree T is 2
